Default methods enable to add new functionality to the interfaces of your libraries and ensure binary compatibility 
with code written for older versions of those interfaces. to developers will not be forced to implement default methods
For example : Iterable interface which is implemented by Collection classes was provided default foreach method
with forcing the Collection classes to implement these methods

Interface default methods help in extending interfaces without having the fear of breaking implementation classes.

Interfaces can not have default methods with same signature of object class (e.g. equals and hashcode)
However it can have overloaded methods
